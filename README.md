- **Product/Delete/{id} (logged-in user, seller of a product)
  - When the logged-in user who is the seller of a product accesses this page, they will be able to initiate the deletion of a product. However, this is a soft delete process, meaning that the product will remain in the database but 
will no longer appear in the product listings. The product can no longer be bought or viewed by users, effectively removing it from the storefront.
After confirming the delete, the seller will be redirected to the product controller,  index action. This process is one-directional and irreversible through the user interface, as once deleted, the product will not be displayed in the system again unless manually restored through the database.
